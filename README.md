### 1. MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

#### I used the Value Iteration, Police Iteration and Q-learning Algorithms for discovering this policy. I have two parts of evaluations based on two different problems. And for each part of evaluations, it has two separate parts. One part is the comparison between Value Iteration and Policy Interation algorithms because both of them are the Dynamic program and they are possible to have optimal solutions. Another part is the Reinforcement learning know as Q-learning evaluation.

### 2.RANDOMIZED LEARNING

####  It talked about the most famous optimized algorithms, which are Randomized hill climbing, simulated annealing, a genetic algorithm, and MIMIC.

### 3.SUPERVISED LEARNING

#### Supervised learning is divided into regression and classification. In my article, I am going to talk about Classification in five different Algorithms.


### 4.UNSUPERVISED LEARNING AND DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION

#### This article will talk about some of the clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms.
