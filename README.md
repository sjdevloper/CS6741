# CS6741 Machine Learning

### MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

#### I used the Value Iteration, Police Iteration and Q-learning Algorithms for discovering this policy. I have two parts of evaluations based on two different problems. And for each part of evaluations, it has two separate parts. One part is the comparison between Value Iteration and Policy Interation algorithms because both of them are the Dynamic program and they are possible to have optimal solutions. Another part is the Reinforcement learning know as Q-learning evaluation
